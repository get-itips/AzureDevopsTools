# AzureDevopsTools
The goal of this project is to share small tools I create using Powershell to query TFS or Azure DevOps.

Currently, there is only one Powershell script to export the list of Release Definitions by every project in CSV format, and I am thinking to improve it a lot.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates! Thanks for reading.
